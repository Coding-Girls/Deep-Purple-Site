## Project Description

Create two HTML pages. The primary must be called `index.html`. Put whatever you want as a title and content on the pages. Each page must have a link to the other page.

## Additional Requirements:
*	Use the following tags at least once:
    *   `<h1>`
    *   `<p>`
    *   `<a>`
    *   `<img>`
    *   `<ol>` and/or `<ul>` respectively with `<li>`
    *   `<table>`, `<td>`, `<tr>`
    *   `<select>`, `<option>`.
*	There are some tags that we have not said anything about. Use `Google` or `W3Schools` to find out what they are doing.

## Optional Requirements:
*	If you want, you can also use tags that are not in the list.
